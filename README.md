A Programming Language like the [C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) that adds some useful features, different syntax, etc that ultimately transpiles to C itself.

## Goals

- [x] Lexical Analysis (Generate Tokens from source file)
- [ ] Parsing (Generate a Syntax Tree from the Tokens)
- [ ] Convert C+ syntax to C syntax
- [ ] Call C compiler and linker to create the executable
- [ ] Success!!!

## Why?

I mainly program using C because of its simpilicty. But some features are kinda bad and some even missing such as defer, shitty macros(preprocessor), shitty variadic functions, etc.

- Why not use [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), doesn't it basically solve all those problems?

Because i don't like feel like its a good language... I'm not an big [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) person and don't get me started on the mess that is called the [templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)). Anyways i won't use C++ as my main language and i'm not quite satisfied with C, so i wondered "why don't i make my own language that adds these features to C?". And that's what i'm trying to do with this project. I'm not talking about creating a completely new programming language from scratch, just change some syntax of C, add these new features and make some of it better. This is also a great exercise to further increase my wisdom of computers.

TL;DR:
- I like C but quite not, (don't likey C++) so create C+ that is in the middle.
- Good opportunity to learn how a programming language works.
- Because it's fun.

## Syntax (WIP)

How hello world would look like:
```C
#include <stdio> // includes remove .h suffix

// argc and argv merged into a static array (new built-in type)
// 'fun' keyword for declaring a function.
fun main(args: [string]) -> int { // return type after the function decl.
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}

```
